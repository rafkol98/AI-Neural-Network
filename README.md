Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important area of Artificial Intelligence with several
real-world applications. In recent years, Deep Learning has become a widely used approach for
NLP problems due to its ability to gain superior performance on various NLP tasks compared to
traditional NLP solving approaches. In this practical, the aim was to tackle a classic NLP problem: the question classification problem. 

Given a question, the goal is to identify what the topic of the question is, e.g., whether it is about food, or a place, or an animal, etc.

The practical consists of four parts:
• Part 1: a basic ANN-based question classifier using the Bag-of-Word
approach.
• Part 2: Look into the issue of sparse matrices when representing
text input for ANNs. Implemented an embedding layer for the input to resolve
the sparsity issue, hence speeding up the computation of the ANN system built in the
previous part.
• Part 3 and Part 4: Make use of a pre-trained word embedding in your ANN system and investigate its impact on the ANN’s performance.
